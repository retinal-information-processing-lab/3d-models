# 3D Models

These models were generated with FreeCAD 0.17.

STL files are provided for the main models and not the auxiliary ones. The main models are:
- [eye slicer](./eye-slicer/)
- [descender](./descender/)
  - [support](./descender/)
  - [top part](./descender/)
  - [bottom part](./descender)
- [ring](./ring/)

## Layer heights

The [eye slicer](./eye-slicer/), the bottom part of the [descender](./descender/) and the ring
[ring](./ring/) should be printed with a resolution of **0.1 mm** (i.e. surface quality takes
priority over speed). Whereas the other models will stand a resolution of **0.2 mm**.
